# Customer-Value-Analysis

This project aims to analyze customer data from a marketing campaign dataset to uncover insights, optimize customer value, and prevent churn. The project involves data exploration, quality checking, customer segmentation, churn prediction modeling, and the development of personalized marketing strategies.

## Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are:

1. *Data Exploration and Quality Checking*: Perform data cleaning by handling missing values, removing outliers, and standardizing data formats.
2. *Customer Segmentation and Behavior Analysis*: Segment customers into distinct groups based on demographics, behaviors, and purchase history using clustering algorithms.
3. *Predict Customer Churn*: Develop an unsupervised learning model to predict customer churn and identify at-risk customers.
4. *Personalised Marketing Algorithm*: Design tailored marketing strategies for each customer segment to improve customer retention and prevent churn.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the "Company's Ideal Customers | Marketing Strategy" dataset from Kaggle, which contains customer information, purchase history, and marketing campaign data from a superstore.

## Implementation
The project is implemented using Python and various data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. The main steps involved are:

1. *Data Preprocessing*: Handle missing values, treat outliers, and transform data into suitable formats.
2. *Customer Segmentation*: Apply K-Means clustering to group customers based on similarities.
3. *Churn Prediction*: Utilize the K-Medoids clustering algorithm and Gower distance metric to predict customer churn.
4. *Marketing Strategy Development*: Based on customer segments and churn predictions, design personalized marketing strategies to retain high-risk customers.
